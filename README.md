# Legacy warning
This is most likely the final release of CANdle library, it is now considered Legacy. We will still provide
technical support for this library and mdtool, guaranteed at least until 2026. 
Further development of the CANdle Ecosystem is going to happen through [CANdle-SDK](https://github.com/mabrobotics/CANdle-SDK)

# CANdle library 
CANdle C++ library is the heart of the MD80 x CANdle ecosystem on the master controller side. 
It takes care of all actions connected to communication and provides API for higher-level software. For a detailed manual please see [MD80 x CANdle Manual](https://www.mabrobotics.pl/servos/manual).
 
## C++ library
To run the examples clone the repo and make sure you're in the `candle` main directory. Execute:
```
mkdir build
cd build 
cmake ..
make
```
After a successful build you should be able to see the compiled examples in `candle/build/` directory. 
To run an example simply call `./exampleX` where `X` is the example number. 
 
## Python library
CANdle Python library was created using [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11). 
You can install the package using the command:
`pip install pyCandleMAB`. Python examples are located in `examples_python` directory. 
 
## Examples
Examples feature simple use cases for most of the methods supplied with the library as well as comments guiding the user 
around the code and implementation. The C++ and Python examples are equivalent. 
 
### Example1
This is a most basic project showcasing a Candle::ping() method. It will ping the FDCAN bus for active drives and print 
all FDCAN IDs (drive IDs) that have responded. It will also blink LEDs on all drives that were detected.
 
### Example 2
This program will ping the FDCAN bus. If any MD80 is found it will print out its rotor position for a few seconds.
 
### Example 3
This is a demonstration of how to properly configure a single MD80. It will ping the drives and set the new current limit 
to the first drive found. It will also change the FDCAN Id of this drive to ```newFDCanId```, which is randomly generated.
There is also a commented save method. If the ```configMd80Save``` stays commented out, the current and FDCAN parameters will be volatile, 
meaning they will be there until the drive is powered down. Using ```configMd80Save``` will make the change permanent 
(or until you change it next time).
 
### Example 4
This example will move the motor in Impedance Control mode, using default controller parameters. The drive will slowly  
perform a sinusoidal movement from the position of -3 [rad] to +3 [rad] from the position at the start.
 
### Example 5
Example 5 is similar to `example 4` with the difference being that the controller parameters are custom this time. Enter the desired control parameters as 'kp' and 'kd' arguments of the command:
```
./example5 kp kd
 
### for example ###
./example5 0.1 0.01
```
Be careful when selecting the kp/kd - with high gains the servos can get quite violent and perform rapid movements!
 
### Example 6 
This example shows how to control more than just one drive - it will ping the FDCAN bus and move all the drives it finds
(up to 12), in a synchronized manner. 
 
### Example 7
Demonstrates Velocity PID mode. The drive will follow a step velocity command - starting at 20 rad/s and going slightly 
faster every ~2 seconds.
 
### Example 8
Shows how Position PID mode works. An example will move the drive in a similar trajectory as Example 4 and 5, but using
a Position PID controller. You can see how it is different from Impedance mode and how much more parameters can be
customized.
 
### Example 9
Showcases usage of multiple CANdles on the same computer using USB bus. 
 
### Example 10
Similar to `example 6`, but based on the SPI bus available on single-board computers. Before running be sure all actuators are switched to 8M speed. 
 
### Example 11
Similar to `example 6`, but based on the UART bus available on single-board computers. Before running be sure all actuators are switched to 8M speed. 
 
### Example 12
Register read-write demo. Please remember that register operations are only valid before candle.begin() is called. 

### Example 13
Profile velocity demo.

### Example 14
Profile position demo.

### Example 15
Raw torque demo.
